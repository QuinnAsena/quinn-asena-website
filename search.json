    "title": "Is the past recoverable from the data? Pseudoproxy modelling of uncertainties in palaeoecological data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper is about constructing a model that generates patterns of ecological change using population growth equations with underlying dynamics such as threshold points. We show how such a model can be used to assess uncertainties in palaeoecological data using a Virtual Ecological approach. The idea is to generate patterns with the same statistical properties that we see in empirical data, and not to recreate a given ecosystem (i.e., this is a phenomenological model). Why do this? We have no experimental manipulations or direct observations of the long time-scales necessary to understand ecosystem-level change, and even the most highly resolved palaeoecological data from laminated sediment cores contain many uncertainties from environmental processes, sampling, and lab processing. In empirical palaeoecology, we have no ‘known truth’ against which to assess our inferences. By using a virtual ecological approach, we can generate data under ‘known’ conditions.\n\nIn reality, we have imperfect knowledge of a perfect world. In simulation, we have perfect knowledge of an imperfect representation of the world.\n\nWhy is this all important? Palaeoecological data provide insight into past ecological and climatic change. This source of data is invaluable to understanding ecological change and potential future ecosystem states. However, the data are highly uncertain, relying on many layers of processing such as lab processing, radiocarbon dating, and age depth modelling. The data are often inconsistently spaced through time and may have large time-gaps between observations. Such sources of uncertainty can, at best, mask ‘true’ signals of change, or at worst, lead to false inferences. One way we can assess the influence of uncertainties on statistical inference is through simulation.\nIf we start with our perfect knowledge of a simulated world, we can also simulate observations from that world, in the same way that we would sample from the real world. This gives us a benchmark dataset, the original simulated data, and a reduced dataset, the sampled simulated data.\nHere is my simulated world (Figure 1). Each species on the right (Figure 1 d) is simulated by a population growth equation. The growth rate of each species is their combined response to the two environmental drivers (Figure 1 b). Their optima and tolerance to each driver (Figure 1 c) determine whether the population growth rate of a species is positive or negative. If the environment is unfavourable, then a species population growth rate becomes negative and it will go locally extinct. Species have the chance to re-establish if conditions become favourable again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visualisation of a simulated core sample: the accumulation rate, time-span and length of the core (a); driver conditions over time (b); the niche of each species with respect to the driving environment (c); and the abundances of pseudoproxies in the archive (d). Each species niche comprises an optima and tolerance for each driver, the optima and tolerance curves in (c) are colour-coded to match each driver in (b). In the context of the proxy system model framework, environmental drivers (b) act on a sensor (c; in this case the response of the sensor is the populations’ growth rate changing in response to the environmental drivers) and records the response of the sensor in an archive (d). The simulation runs from past to present, the first time-step being the oldest.\n\n\n\nThe number of species in (Figure 1) is only a fraction of those simulated. There are actually around 200 potential species, and about 15-40 in existence at any given point in the simulation (depending on the replicate). I simulated a bunch of different driving environments (e.g., one where the environmental driver undergoes an abrupt shift), in the example above (Figure 1) the ‘slow linear’ driver will eventually drive species that existed at the beginning of the simulation locally extinct (unless they were very generalist species!), and new species would establish and thrive.\nWe then take those simulated species abundances (Figure 1 d), remember this is our ‘perfect’ benchmark data, and degrade them with mixing (i.e., a physical process that alters the core), sub-sampling (i.e., slicing up the core into 1 cm segments at given intervals for processing), and proxy counting (i.e., the counting of species under a microscope from the 1 cm segments after lab processing). Figure 2 shows how we start with absolute abundances of species, and recreate the observational process, ultimately resulting in data that look a lot more like what we see in reality from proxy-data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sample model output showing two species, visualising data from the error-free reference (a) and one treatment level from each: mixing (b); mixing combined with sub-sampling (c); and mixing combined with sub-sampling and proxy counting (d). Mixing over 10 time-steps is shown as a magnified section of species 56 displaying the error-free reference transitioning to the mixed data (b). The mixed data are then sub-sampled every 10 cm, with a thickness of 1 cm (c) and the sub-sampled data are counted at a resolution of 400 individuals per sub-sample (d). Red dashed lines indicate disturbance events that occur randomly throughout the simulation.\n\n\n\nThis is what a larger subset of the simulated species looks like before and after the virtual degradation and sub-sampling process (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Visualisation of the environmental drivers, the ‘error-free’ benchmark pseudoproxy archive, and pseudoproxies mixed over 10 time-steps, sub-sampled at 10 cm intervals and counted at a resolution of 400 individuals per sub-sample. A subset of 10 species from the pool of 200 is shown. The ‘error-free’ record shows the absolute abundances per time-step and represents ‘perfect’ knowledge of the system through time, the degraded and sampled record is converted to relative abundances and represents observations comparable to empirical proxy records. Accumulation rate and depth are not pictured in favour of a more complete species record. Note that the y-axis is in simulation time, the most recent section of core is time-step 5000.\n\n\n\nFinally, we analyse both sets of data. In simulation the three sources of uncertainty (mixing, sub-sampling, and proxy counting) are applied individually, and in combination, at increasing levels of severity. So we end up with 1210 (per simulation replicate!) datasets from the ‘error-free’ benchmark to the most degraded. We analyse them all! But here is an example of the benchmark, and one level of degradation (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Fisher Information (a) and PrCs (b) of both the ‘error-free’ pseudoproxies, and the degraded and sub-sampled data for Scenario 1. The blue highlighted region in the FI indicates a ~700-year period of reversed directionality. The highlighted regions in the PrCs indicate, in the analyses of the degraded and sub-sampled data, two periods of different rates of change in the PrC. The same regions are highlighted in the ‘error-free’ analysis where no apparent change is visible. Red dashed lines indicate disturbance events for both FI and PrCs.\n\n\n\nThis figure shows two different multivariate community analyses (Fisher Information and principal curves), and how the results change between the ‘error-free’ data and the degraded and sub-sampled dataset. At the start, I mentioned that uncertainty can lead to incorrect inference. This example is only of one randomly selected model replicate, but it shows how interpretations can be influenced by uncertainties. The 700 year-long period of reversed directionality in Fisher Information (Figure 4 A) can change our inference from a system increasing in stability, to decreasing in stability (a decrease in Fisher Information is interpreted as a system becoming less predictable less stable). The principal curve changing from a gradual increase (a good representation of change driven by the primary driver system), to a sigmoidal shape (Figure 4 B), can alter our interpretation of the ‘true’ rate of species turnover in the system. This example demonstrates well how a Virtual Ecological approach can be used to assess uncertainty and its influence on statistical inference."

These are properties of dynamical systems that appear not only in ecological systems but also social, climate, and economic ones (and many more!).

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a sneak preview into work that is in review. I will post a link to the published version.\nIn my previous post, I described the phenomenological model used to generate species patterns that mimic the statistical properties of empirical data. How can we use this approach to quantify the relative influence of sources of uncertainty on the statistical inferences we make from palaeoecological data?\nI’ll pick up where I left off in the last post. In short, we simulate a whole bunch of species and begin to systematically degrade the data with physical processes (in this case core mixing), sub-sampling strategies (taking 1 cm thick slices of sediment at given intervals), and proxy counting (counting and identifying species in a sub-sample). Because each of these three sources of uncertainty are introduced to the data individually, and combined, at 10 levels each, we end up with 1210 datasets per replicate simulation! There are 30-35 replicate simulations, multiplied by four different scenarios varying the driving conditions. That is terabytes of data! We want to know the relative influence of the three sources of uncertainty (mixing, sub-sampling, and proxy counting) on the two statistical analyses (Fisher Information and principal curves), from the ‘error-free’ benchmark to the most degraded and least intensively sampled.\nTo compare the Fisher Information and principal curve analyses of the ecological communities across the 1210 datasets we used Feature Analysis for Time series. This further reduces the time-seties into a set of ‘features’ that describe the time-series. We can then use Euclidean distance to measure the distance between the features of each dataset and the original benchmark. These distances are then summarised across the replicate simulations (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Conceptual data-flow of the degradation, sampling, and analysis process. Treatments of mixing, sub-sampling and proxy counting are applied individually and in combination to the replicate pseudoproxy archive. Fisher’s information (FI) and principal curves (PrC) are applied separately to each treatment level and subsequently analysed using feature analysis for time-series (FATs). Extracted features are scaled and Euclidean distance between each treatment level and the ‘error-free’ reference core is calculated.\n\n\n\nOk, the methods are not very easy to describe in simple terms… They will be described in detail when the paper comes out. So for the time being, let’s jump to the exciting results!\n\nThe uncertainties are introduced to the data systematically. By introducing the uncertainties individually, we can see how the Euclidean distance increases from our benchmark data (Figure 2). It is interesting the Euclidean distance increases steadily with mixing, while the Euclidean distance does not increase a great deal as the proxy count is reduced. Decreasing sub-sampling intervals are having the strongest influence on the Euclidean distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The median (dots), 25th, and 75th quantiles (error-bars and shaded area) of the Euclidean distance from the ‘error-free’ core of features extracted from the Fisher’s information (A) and PrC distances (B) calculated across replicate simulations.\n\n\n\nIt is useful to see the different influence of the uncertainties when applied individually. However, this result is expected. We know that data become worse if we ruin them! What we want to find out is which sources of uncertainty have the strongest influence, and which ones interact when applied in combination.\nIn the following figure (Figure 3), two sources of uncertainty are plotted, one on each axis. What we are interested in here is whether the Euclidean distance increases along the diagonal of the plot, indicating an interaction between the uncertainties. By far the strongest influence is from the combined effect of proxy counting and sub-sampling (Figure 3 C). There appears to be little interaction between mixing and either proxy counting and sub-sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Mean Euclidean distance from the ‘error-free’ core of two treatments combined calculated across replicate simulations for Fisher’s infomation. The mixing axis shows the number of time-steps over which mixing occurs. Along the sub-sampling axis, the frequency of sub-sampling in centimetres is shown, and the proxy counting axis displays count resolutions in number of individuals counted per sample. In the proxy counting treatment, uncertainty increases as count resolution decreases.\n\n\n\nIn the main paper, all three uncertainties are combined and visualised. I won’t go there in this short summary! What does this all mean for palaeoecologists?\nThis approach allows us to make informed decisions around sampling strategies and lab hours spend quantifying proxies. Where should we focus money and effort in a study depending on the research question of interest? We can use this approach to assess how strong the influence of sources of uncertainty are on different statistical methods. Understanding uncertainties is crucial to understanding how reliable our inferences are from the data we have."

    "title": "A Bibliometric Review and Topic Analysis of Climate Justice Literature: Mapping Trends, Voices, and the Way Forward",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this paper by Meg Parsons, we explored research trends in the literature around the topic of climate justice since its conception. I was the quantitative expert and analysed the corpus using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify trends in the literature.\nLDA uses the word frequencies from a corpus to assign documents in the corpus to arbitrary ‘topics’. For example, if we took a corpus around the subject ‘nuclear’, the corpus will probably be characterised by words like ‘sustainable’, ‘energy’, ‘green’, and ‘disaster’, ‘fallout’, ‘meltdown’, and ‘weapon’, ‘conflict’… and so on. Words will cluster around ‘topics’, that are described by those words. The LDA model is agnostic and does not know what the ‘topics’ are, but we can identify that there are themes in the words that characterise the topics, such as ‘energy’, ‘conflict/politics’, maybe ‘social movements’, and other topics.\n‘Climate Justice’ was first mentioned in a published article in 1997 by Ian H. Rowlands, and between 1997 and 2021 has seen 1683 published works on the Scopus database that had enough text (e.g., an abstract) that I could use for the analysis.\nSix overall topics emerged from the literature that we assigned the following descriptions to (Figure 1):\n\nEducation and food security\nSustainable development and policy\nInternational relations and carbon emissions\nHealth, vulnerability and adaptation\nPolicy and activism\nHuman rights and indigenous people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Six topics (corpus) identified through topic modelling within the published papers, with the keywords appearing most frequently within each topic.\n\n\n\nWe can also see how many documents belong to each topic over time (Figure 2). Each document gets a score per topic, and may not belong only to one topic, but we can still reasonably map out the trends. It is also true that there were not many documents published on climate justice in the early years, so interpret the first decade with that in mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The proportion of the literature belonging to a given topic over time.\n\n\n\nTopics 1 and 2 around sustainability and international relations, respectively, make up a consistent, and substantial proportion of the literature. Smaller topics 1, 4, 5, and 6 have seen a small increase over time.\nI won’t comment a great deal in this summary on the interpretation of the results as the subject area is Meg’s expertise. I would not be able to do justice to the extensive work she did as the primary author (and of course co-authors Danielle and Johanna!) and qualitative analyst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible workflow\n\n\n\nTo maintain a smooth workflow between me and collaborators, I host my analyses as a link on GitHub. The workflow is reproducible, and collaborators can see the latest results by following the same link:\n\nHere is the whole workflow\nThe code is available on my GitHub and on Figshare"
